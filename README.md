# Airbnb-clone-project
This is a personal version of the AirBnB Clone project, built as part of my journey through the ALX Software Engineering program. The aim is to understand how large-scale applications like AirBnB are structured and how the front-end and back-end interact to deliver real-time, dynamic user experiences.

As an ambitious woman in tech from Lagos,Nigeria, I am committed to building real-world applications that reflect both creativity and technical depth. This project is a stepping stone in that direction.

## Project Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with front-end and back-end integration.
- Deepen my understanding of web architecture (MVC, REST APIs).
- Practice using Git and GitHub for collaboration and version control.
- Strengthen my ability to build responsive and accessible web interfaces.
- Build a strong portfolio project to showcase to future employers.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / MySQL (production-ready)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Postman
- **Deployment**: Coming soon (Render/Heroku)

## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/TemsDesign222/airbnb-clone-project.git
